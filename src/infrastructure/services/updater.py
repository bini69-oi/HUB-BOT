"""Self-update check: is a newer revision available on GitHub than the one we're running?

The product ships via git-pull + `docker compose build` (scripts/update.sh). The bot runs
inside a container and can't touch the host git/daemon, so it can't compute "latest" locally.
Instead it compares the git short-SHA baked into the image at build time (``APP__BUILD_SHA``,
set by install.sh/update.sh) against the latest commit of the tracked branch on GitHub.

Everything is fail-soft: a network blip or a missing build SHA just reports "no update".
