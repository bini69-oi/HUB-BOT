"""In-bot admin panel (owner/admin only).

Full management from the chat itself: stats, analytics, user management, broadcasts,
promocodes, gift-code batches, sale campaigns, quick toggles and branding. The whole
sub-tree is gated by a router-level ``IsAdmin`` filter, so non-admins fall through to
normal user handlers instead of relying on a per-handler guard we could forget.

Every screen reuses the same services/DAOs as the web cabinet — no logic is duplicated.
